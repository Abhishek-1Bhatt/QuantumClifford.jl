A Julia package for working with quantum stabilizer states and Clifford circuits
that act on them.

Works efficiently with
[pure](@ref Stabilizers) and
[mixed stabilizer](@ref Mixed-Stabilizer-States)
states of thousands of qubits
as well as
[sparse or dense Clifford operations](@ref Clifford-Operators)
acting upon them.

Provides
[canonicalization](@ref Canonicalization-of-Stabilizers),
[projection](@ref Projective-Measurements), and
[generation](@ref Generating-a-Pauli-Operator-with-Stabilizer-Generators) operations,
as well as
[partial traces](@ref Partial-Traces).
